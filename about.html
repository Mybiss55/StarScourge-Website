            <h2>Entry 103: Gameplay</h2>
            <h3>
                Gameplay is going to be a rougelike type of game. On the world map we will have a bunch of places to visit, like I mentioned in my last post. Those places will all have a different style and feel to them while also being procedurally generated. However, it will also have set piece areas which will be used for story events/boss battles. I feel like having a lot of these be secrets will also make the game more enjoyable. The Dungeons will be more of a discover new things sort of deal.
                I also think we should drop the "level up" System that a lot of games have. I think it should be a majority skill based and that the player is in control of how powerful the character is. Because just adding more intense attack patterns the "very skillful player vs slime king with wild attack patterns" seems better than having "level 100 slime king vs level 99 mage rpg battle." Very much akin to Dark Souls very much akin to Hades.

            <h3> 
            
            Progress is smooth, currently working on the story! Got some sick ideas about how the world is gonna go. I am thinking we will have a world like Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky. BUT! One key difference will be that the entire world will be completely open world.
            This will allow the player to select where they would like to start the game. Kind of like how Octopath Traveller does it or those pokemon fan games. Which will have everything around the spawn scale with it. I really want players to be given a challenge.

             <h2>Entry 101: Main Character</h2>
             <h3>
                 Now I am thinking that the Main Character will be a Scholar kind of guy, which is why these are called Scholarly Logs, I think this kind of character archetypes has a lot of potential for being a great character.
                 
                 Their whole deal will be that they want to write their PhD paper on the monsters of the world. Trying to prove themselves to their fellow colleges. 
                 So the whole opening section will be them preparing for the expedition out into the wilds to find whatever it is they are looking for. (We can even base character creation on what they are looking for to prove their thesis) This Section will be the tutorial section of the game.
                 It will also give the Main Character a good starting point to go out into the world and get into some crazy hijinks with the outside world. 
                 I also think that having the main Character be morally ambiguous will make the story more impactful. As in he will do anything to get his fame and glory. Potentially depending on the players choices he will change, or it could be a static story with just one story-line. We'll see.
