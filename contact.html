            <h2>
                When will the Game come out?
            </h2>
            <h3>
                The game is currently still in the planning stage. In fact I haven't even started coding the game, however I am working hard on learning some game engines to improve my game dev skills.

                What are those Game Engines?
            </h2>
            <h3>
                The game Engines that I am learning are Godot and Unity. They are used for both 2D and 3D games and are very popular right now. Godot is a newer engine while Unity is more established.

                What is your GameDev experience?
            </h2>
            <h3>
                My GameDev experience consists of a basic understanding of how Unity and Godot work. However, I have used both RPG Maker and Clickteam fusion before when I was younger. I made a couple basic games on RPG Maker and Clickteam, but I have yet to make anything substantial in Untiy or Godot.

                Why do you want to make a game?
            </h2>
            <h3>
                I have always wanted to make a game ever since I was a young boy. I don't feel like there is much money in it for a solo Game Developer, but that isn't why I want to make a game. I feel like putting all these ingredients together can really make something special, sort of a culmination of myself into a work of art.

            <h2>
                Do you think AI will take over Game Development?
            </h2>
            <h3>
                In my unprofessional opinion I feel like it will only help people make a game. And in the end I want to say that even if an AI can make a game in a couple of seconds, nothing will compare humans making games for whatever reason.

                 Why are these questions the way they are?
            </h2>
            <h3>
                 Well, not many people have asked me many questions about my game. These are actually just questions I am asking myself. It is kind of cathartic to write these down though. Hopefully someone will find these lines of text endearing or maybe I'll just look back and remember the good old days. Who knows!

                What is your education?
            </h2>
            <h3>
                I am currently in a 3 year program for computer programming. I may also take a GameDev course after I am done my current program, but it all depends on if I can finish a external GameDev course I have.

                 Right now I work as a McDonalds Manager, but I dream of starting my own GameDev company which is why I made this website as sort of a test to see if I have the creative ability to make a game. I think I do!!
